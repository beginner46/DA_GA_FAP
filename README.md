# Using-Genetic-Algorithm-for-Dynamic-Allocation-of-Facility-Location.

The aim of this project was to use the given data set to derive solution to the problem of dynamic facility allocation, the facilities in this case are the rescue hubs like fire station and small dispencary/hospitals.

Focus was to cater to the need of an emergency situation keeping various factors in mind, such as travel time and probable number of emergency cases during a particular time of the day.
